<h2> some copypastas: </h2>
<p>The Game is a mental game where the objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself.<br> Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss,
 which must be announced each time it occurs.
 It is impossible to win most versions of The Game. Depending on the variation of The Game, 
the whole world, or all those aware of the game, are playing it all the time.<br> Tactics have been developed to increase the number of people 
aware of The Game and thereby increase the number of losses.
<br>
The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater)
